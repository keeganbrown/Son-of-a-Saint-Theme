                  <dd>Each year, Son of a Saint selects a group of boys ages 10-13 to join the existing kids in our program. The boys must be fatherless due to their father's incarceration, death or abandonment. Each boy remains a member of Son of a Saint until he is 18 and receives his college acceptance letter.</dd>

                  <dd>Son of a Saint equips boys with the tools they need to become productive men. We give them hope, vision and opportunity. We provide a secure and consistent environment for them. But the Son of a Saint mentorsâ€™ most important role is simply to be a good example.</dd>
                  <dt>We have expectations.</dt>
                  <dd>Boys must maintain a minimum 2.7 GPA, complete four hours of community service each month and maintain good conduct at home, school and within the Son of a Saint organization.</dd>
